# Diversity Workshop

<font size="2.5">
The Diversity Workshop provides a forum for underrepresented students at the
graduate and advanced undergraduate levels who have an interest in computer
systems research. The workshop program will include technical talks, panel
sessions, and interactive events offered and organized by leading researchers in
academia and industry, covering topics about system research and general career
development tips. The overall goal of the workshop is to strengthen the pipeline
of underrepresented systems students, providing them with advice and networking
opportunities that they might not otherwise receive.   
  
The workshop will take place in the Lawren Harris Room.
